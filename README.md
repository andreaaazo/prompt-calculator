This is a simple calculator program built with Dart that runs in the terminal. It allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication, and division.

## üíª Installation

To install the calculator program, you must have Dart installed on your computer. If you don't have Dart installed, you can download it from the official Dart website: [https://dart.dev/get-dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

Once you have Dart installed, you can clone the project from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/terminal-calculator.git` 
```

Navigate to the project directory using the terminal and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
dart pub get
```

## üöÄ Usage

To use the calculator program, navigate to the project directory using the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
dart bin/calculator.dart
``` 
_or_
```bash
dart run
```
This will start the calculator program in the terminal. The program will then prompt you to select an arithmetic operation by typing one of the following options:

-   `1` for addition
-   `2` for multiplication
-   `3` for division

After selecting an operation, the program will prompt you to enter the numbers you want to perform calculations with, separated by commas. For example, if you want to add two numbers, you would type `1` and then `1,2`. The program will then output the result `3`.

## ü§ù Contributing
